# wallpaper-cam
Use background camera to set wallpaper on windows with time, weather and earthquake info, here I used a Intel RealSense D400 camera.

Use PyOwm and PIL which you can identify the city ID and UI setting.

Check https://pyowm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ and https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/for more infomation.

Earthquake API is based on the api of p2pquake which user can customize.
